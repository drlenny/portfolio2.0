My previous iteration of this site was only HTML and javascript using a template as a base. I decided to redesign it to better display my web development and design capabilities as well as get more experience with React. The goal when doing so was to create a site that was simple, clean, and intuitive and I am very pleased with the result.",

I intend to add additional pages with more relevant resources with this design goal in mind.",
